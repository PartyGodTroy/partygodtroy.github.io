            <h2>Starting a Blog with Astro: A Journey into Web, CMS, and Game Development</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! If youâ€™re passionate about Web Development, CMS Development, and Game Development, youâ€™ve come to the right place. This blog is a platform where Iâ€™ll share my experiences, learnings, and insights in these areas. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned developer or just starting out, I hope youâ€™ll find something valuable here.</p>
            
            <h3>The Stack</h3>
            <p>Our journey will be powered by an exciting tech stack that includes Astro.js, Babylon.js, HTMX, and Tailwind CSS. Letâ€™s take a brief look at each of these:</p>
            
            <ul class="ml-10 text-lg py-5 grid gap-5 xl:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-2">
                <li><b>Astro.js</b>: A front-end framework for building modern websites with less client-side JavaScript.</li>
                <li><b>Babylon.js</b>: A powerful, open-source 3D rendering engine for creating stunning games in the browser.</li>
                <li><b>HTMX</b>: A library that allows you to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, and Server Sent Events directly in HTML.</li>
                <li><b>Tailwind CSS</b>: A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive layouts with ease.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Whatâ€™s Next?</h4>
            <p>In the coming posts, weâ€™ll dive deeper into each of these technologies. Weâ€™ll explore how they work, how to use them effectively, and how they can be combined to create amazing projects. From building interactive web pages with Astro.js and Tailwind CSS, to creating dynamic content management systems, to developing immersive games with Babylon.js, thereâ€™s a lot to look forward to.
